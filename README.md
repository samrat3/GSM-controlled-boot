# GSM-controlled-boot
This is an embedded System project to develop a practical boot to sent control signal to boot via GSM and work accordingly.
There are some basic commands that can be sent to boot are :-
        1. Direction to move.
        2. change speed.
        3. change gear(Implementedd virtually in controller board).
The full implementation and simulation is done on proteas 8.0.
The system is based on PIC controller.
The code is written in Embedded C language and IDE used is MpLABX .
